**Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)** 

https://github.com/JennMartinez/liri-node-app.git

LIRI works from the command line, interacting and displaying data in the terminal/bash, utilizing node.js.

The user inputs data from the command line, and based on the data, LIRI will respond and give an output based on the users request.

Once in the terminal/bash and on the command line, the user must type, node liri.js, to access LIRI.

The user will have four command options to choose from, when interacting with LIRI: 

        - BandsInTown 
        - Spotify
        - OMDB
        - DoWhatItSays
        
To access the **BandsInTown option**, go to the command line and type, node liri.js BandsInTown "Type any **musical artist/band** in quotation marks" then press return to run the code.
