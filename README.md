**Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)** 

https://github.com/JennMartinez/liri-node-app.git

LIRI works from the command line, interacting and displaying data in the terminal.

The user inputs data from the command line, and based on the data, LIRI will respond with and output to the users request.

Once in the terminal and on the command line, the user must type, node liri.js, to access LIRI.

The user will have four options to choose from, when interacting with LIRI: 

        - BandsInTown 
        - Spotify
        - OMDB
        - DoWhatItSays
        
To access the **BandsInTown option**, go to the command line and type, node liri.js BandsInTown "Type any musical artist/band in quotation marks" then press return. Using the arrow keys, choose BandsInTown and press the return key once again. There should be a display of the musical artist/band of the users choice that was placed in the quotation marks.

To access the **Spotify** option, go to the command line and type, node liri.js Spotify "Type any song in quotation marks" then press return. Using the arrow keys, choose Spotify and press the return key once again. There should be a display of the song of the users choice that was placed in the quotation marks.

To access the **OMDB** option, go to the command line and type, node liri.js OMDB "Type any movie in quotation marks" then press return. Using the arrow keys, choose OMDB and press the return key once again. There should be a display of the movie of the users choice that was placed in the quotation marks.

To access the **DoWhatItSays** option, go to the command line and type, node liri.js DoWhatItSays "Type any command/request in quotation marks" then press return. Using the arrow keys, choose DoWhatItSays and press the return key once again. There should be a display of the command/request of the users choice that was placed in the quotation marks.
